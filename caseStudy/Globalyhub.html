                                To start a new website, research was performed on what contents to be placed, several brainstorming and ideas were created and discussed, checking out what others in our industry are doing. This helped us design a site that meets user needs, stands out from competitors, and align with business goals.

                                Started with the wireframes. Many variations of wireframes were made on basis of sitemaps that were created. Then final discussion was conducted once wireframes were finished and final design was picked based on their interest of choice.

                            <p>
                                To establish a consistent and appealing visual identity, I created moodboards and defined the overall visual style for the application. This included designing the logo, selecting a cohesive color palette, and choosing typography that aligned with the brand’s tone and target audience. These foundational elements ensured visual consistency across the entire user interface and helped set the tone for a modern, accessible learning experience.
