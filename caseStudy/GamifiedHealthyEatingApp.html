A sample of individuals from different demographics was surveyed to gather information on their eating habits, time management practices, nutritional knowledge, commitment to dietary goals, and experiences with fast food choices. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted with a subset of participants to gain deeper insights into their struggles and perceptions.
