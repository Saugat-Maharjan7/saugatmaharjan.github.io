                                As part of research process we clearly outline the goals of the research, determined what insights are wanted to gather about the target audience, their preferences, and their needs for finding travel companions. For this purpose we conducted a survey within our college and friends’ groups which helped us in data collection and analysis. We also had our own brainstorming session and insights in our group since this was the group project for the final semester.
