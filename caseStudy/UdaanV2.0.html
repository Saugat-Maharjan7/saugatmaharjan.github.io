                                        UDAAN is a mobile Learning Management System (LMS) aimed at providing accessible education through structured online courses. The existing app (Version 1.0) required a UI/UX overhaul to enhance usability, align with modern design standards, and address user pain points. The redesign project was scoped for a 1-month timeline and focused on delivering a comprehensive, user-centered design solution.

                                The existing version of the app was limited in features, featured an outdated design, and suffered from a complex, cluttered interface. It lacked a clear user flow, often leading to confusion and distraction during use. Navigating the app was particularly challenging for existing users, reducing overall usability and engagement.
                                <br>With plans to introduce additional features and enhanced functionality, stakeholders recognized the need for a complete revamp â€” aiming to deliver a more intuitive, modern, and user-friendly experience through a redesigned version.

                                The primary goal of the new version of Udaan was to simplify navigation, ensuring that users of all age groups could effortlessly find what they were looking for. The core idea was to create an intuitive and distraction-free experience, allowing users to access relevant content with ease.
                                <br>Given the diverse range of courses offered by the organization â€” from bridge course preparation for +2 students to entrance exam preparation for fields such as Loksewa, engineering, and medicine â€” the application needed to support a scalable and organized structure.
                                <br>The redesign aimed to establish a robust and future-proof platform capable of staying competitive in the market for the next 2 to 3 years.

                            <p>
                                To initiate the revamp of the application, we began by collaborating closely with the client and key stakeholders to align on the vision and objectives. Through a series of planning sessions and brainstorming workshops, we explored various ideas and outlined how we envisioned the new application to function and feel.
                                <br>Following these discussions, we adopted a modular approach to features, ensuring each module seamlessly connected to a well-defined user flow. During the first phase, we developed a comprehensive information architecture and finalized the primary navigation system.
                                <br>Additionally, we identified both direct and indirect competitors, conducting a detailed competitive analysis to evaluate the features we aimed to implement. This analysis provided valuable insights and helped us clearly define the structure and direction of the new design. Once finalized, the structural foundation of the application was locked in for further development.

                                The redesign process began with collaborative sessions involving the client and stakeholders to align on the product vision. Multiple brainstorming meetings were conducted to explore potential solutions, leading to a modular approach where features were mapped according to user flow. A comprehensive information architecture was developed, and primary navigation was finalized early in the process.
                                <br>A detailed competitive analysis was conducted to benchmark the application against both direct and indirect competitors, helping define the overall structure and feature set. With clear direction and structure in place, the project moved into the execution phase.
                                <br>Given the tight 1-month timeline, efficient collaboration was crucial. Regular update meetings were held every two days to track progress, align on next steps, and ensure the project stayed on course.

                                We began the redesign process with a thorough competitive analysis, identifying both direct and indirect competitors to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and feature offerings. This helped us benchmark industry standards and uncover opportunities for improvement. By mapping our desired features against competitor platforms, we gained a clear understanding of the structure and user experience we wanted to achieve. These insights guided the finalization of the appâ€™s core architecture, which was then locked for the next phases of design.

                                We began the design phase by creating multiple wireframe variations based on the sitemap, which was developed with the assistance of AI tools. One tool worth highlighting is UX Pilot, which significantly streamlined the process of idea generation and structural planning. These wireframes helped us visualize key user flows, validate layout decisions early, and iterate quickly before moving into high-fidelity design.

                                To establish a consistent and appealing visual identity, I created moodboards and defined the overall visual style for the application. This included designing the logo, selecting a cohesive color palette, and choosing typography that aligned with the brandâ€™s tone and target audience. These foundational elements ensured visual consistency across the entire user interface and helped set the tone for a modern, accessible learning experience.
