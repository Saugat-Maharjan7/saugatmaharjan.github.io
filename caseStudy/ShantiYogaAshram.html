                                As part of initial research process, after I first navigated to their old website and had research about how the content can be managed. We had 2 to 3 meetings regarding what contents should be displayed for user-centric design and how the contents can be aligned. We figured out the most important pages that should be more focused. We aligned with a propsed pages and then a sitemap was created upon which the whole website would be build on.

                                As an conclusion of the research, I found out what the organization wants to make a new revamp website and then worked on page layouts and contents to be placed. On thorough research, a proposed pages were finalized where the contents needed to be placed and modified accordingly.

                                Started with the wireframes. The wireframes were created with multiple variations for each page for sharing how the website should look and feel. Then final discussion was conducted once wireframes were finished and final design was picked based on their interest of choice.

                                To establish a consistent and appealing visual identity, I created moodboards and defined the overall visual style for the application. This included designing the logo, selecting a cohesive color palette, and choosing typography that aligned with the brand’s tone and target audience. These foundational elements ensured visual consistency across the entire user interface and helped set the tone for a modern, accessible learning experience.
